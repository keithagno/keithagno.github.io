I made this program in my ICS 212 class and will translate a International Morse Code in English through command line input. 
I made an array of Morse Code called morse[]. Each elements corresponds to each Morse Code and its letter.

And then the nested for loop will check the user's argument input is the same with the morse[] array. Will return the letters instead of the Morse Code when it passes.
