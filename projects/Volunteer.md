 My mother used to work for Kina 'Ole and I was invited to join them. I was excited to be able to help the senior citizens and let them get a taste of the beautiful sceneries around the island. We ended the day by watching the Polynesian Cultural Center Night Show.
 The elders were happy that day. I experienced the hardwork my mother. It was a tough job, but rewarding as I was able to bring joy and  happiness to the senior citizens. This gave me the opportunity to learn and acquire new non-academic skills.
