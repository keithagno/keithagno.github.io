  Human brains are so powerful that we can learn anything that we want. There are many types of programming languages out there, some were made to do specific tasks. JavaScript, for example, is a new language that I have just started learning for my IcS 314 class. I believe that JavaScript will be really helpful in many ways that I cannot imagine.

  My first impression of JavaScript is, "Wow this is different... and better." Comparing to Java, JavaScript is way easier and less complex. Doing the FreeCodeCamp was really helpful for me to understand what JavaScript is. The basics are similar accross other programming languages, but as you get more into coding, JavaScript is more straightforward. So far I am liking JavaScript. Last spring, I took ICS 212 where I learned the basics of both C and C++. It was interesting because there are built-in functions ready for us to use. Unlike C and C++, JavaScript does not have to include other files. For example:
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <time.h> // Time function.
  #include <stdlib.h> // Random number generator functions.
  
  The word I can use to describe JavaScript is simplicity. It is easier to use, even a beginner like me did not have any troube learning it. I will need to keep learning more, and memorize different functions and codes to be able to use it proficiently. As for my ICS 314, I am new to this kind of class and it is stressful at the moment. The WODs, specifically, are stressful. I am used to doing my own coding at my own pace. WODs takes it to another level. I hope to get used to it, so that it may help me in the future as I work with others.
