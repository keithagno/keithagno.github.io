  Human brains are so powerful that we can learn anything that we want. There are many type of programming languages out there. Some were made that will specifically do something. JavaScript, for example, is a new language that I have just started learning for my IcS 314 class. I believe JavaScript is really helpful in many ways that I can imagine.

  My first impression of JavaScript is, "Wow this is different.... and better." Comparing to Java, JavaScript is way easier and less complex. Doing the FreeCodeCamp was really helpful for me to understand what is in JavaScript. The simple parts are similar, but as you get more into coding, JavaScript is better. So far I am liking it. Last spring, I took ICS 212 where I learned both C and C++. It was intersting. Like in C and C++, there are built in functions ready for us to use anytime. The difference is you do not have to include them in JavaScript like for example:
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <time.h> // Time function.
  #include <stdlib.h> // Random number generator functions.
  
  The word I can describe JavaScript is Simplicity. It is simple and easy to use. I will need to keep learning more, and memorize different functions and codes in JavaScript to be able to use it proficiently. As for my ICS 314, I am new to this kind of class and it is stressful at the moment. The WODs, specifically, are stressful. I am used to doing my own coding in my own pace. WODs takes it to another level. I hope to get used to it and help me in the future as I work with others.
