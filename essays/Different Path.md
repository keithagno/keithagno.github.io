  I never thought I would cross paths with Sofware Engineering. Engineering is not in my field and major, so I expected only Engineering majors to take this class. While learning about what Software Engineering really is, it makes me think twice that taking ICS 314 is beneficial for me to build my skills. 
 
  Seeing the modules for this class, I am interested in learning HTML, CSS, and UI Design. This will be really helpful especially for when I may use it in the future. I want to learn more about JavaScript and how I can imply it in real world problems. With the weekly WODs we have in this class, I know it will help me get used to the pressure when I hopefully start my career. As of now, it is pretty stressful since I am not a fast coder as I usually take my time to do it. 
  
  In my opinion, I believe JavaScript will take over as it is superior compared to other programming languages. Knowing what obstacles I will face within this course, I will need to adapt to the fast paced environment and keep track of all the assignments we will recieve. Having other courses puts a toll on me, but I have to make sure I finish everything on time and not get behind. I am looking forward to passing and completing this course, and getting to learn something from it.
